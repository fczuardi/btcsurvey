## 1. Why? (Motivation & Relevance)
Bitcoin Street Surveys Database: Collaborative Innovation for Real-World Impact

Hackathons have immense potential to drive Bitcoin adoption and innovation. However, they often miss real-world impact due to siloed efforts and lack of relevant data.

The Problem:

    Disjointed Efforts – Teams work in isolation, limiting collaboration.
    Missed Opportunities – Time is spent on projects that lack practical application.

To maximize innovation, we need a shared data resource that connects projects to real-world needs.

## 2. What? (Concept & Theory)
Real-World Data: The Missing Link

    Gathering Insights – Collecting real-world data is expensive and slow.
    Bridging the Gap – Hackathons rarely connect projects with actual Bitcoin users’ needs.

A Collaborative Solution:

    Open Database – A shared repository of survey responses on Bitcoin usage and challenges.
    Public Access – Open for everyone to contribute and analyze.

Sample Questions:

    Tourist or Local? – Understand Bitcoin user demographics.
    Bitcoin Knowledge – Measure Bitcoin understanding in different regions.
    Financial Education – Identify gaps in financial literacy and adoption.

## 3. How? (Application & Process)
Unlocking Potential

With a publicly accessible dataset, hackathon teams can:
✅ Leverage Data – Use real-world insights to design impactful solutions.
✅ Increase Relevance – Ensure projects align with actual user needs.
✅ Engage Communities – Foster local participation in data collection and innovation.

Implementation Steps:

    Collect Data – Encourage Bitcoin users to share insights via surveys.
    Structure & Open-Source It – Create a transparent, collaborative database.
    Hackathons Use It – Enable teams to access insights and build meaningful solutions.

## 4. What If? (Impact & Future Vision)
A Win-Win Scenario

🚀 Real-World Impact – Solutions address genuine problems in Bitcoin adoption.
🤝 Community Empowerment – Individuals contribute to and benefit from the data.
